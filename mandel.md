**Final project**

### Have you ever heard the name Mandelbrot?
The **Mandelbrot set** is the set of complex numbers  c for which the function f(z)=z**2+c does not diverge to infinity when iterated from z=0. 
here is a picture of it:

This is my project(what I should work on).
First let’s talk about python part. It was full of colors and beautiful.
This is the output of python code:

Now I wanna talk about the main part ”c codes”. That was really hard. It takes a lot of time to be done. I wrote functions to zoom, rotate and change the center of the picture to search in this world.
with each zoom you will  see new and unique shape. In this picture you can see what I mean:

I made a video of my searching in this amazing world and I add some music in video that I made it with coding!
If you wanna to know how , you should install sonic pi and enjoy it yourself.
